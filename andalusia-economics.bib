abstract = "This paper presents an input–output model of sectoral water consumption, created by combining the extended Leontief input–output model with the model of energy use developed by Proops. The analysis is applied to Andalusia, a region situated in the South of Spain which is characterized by water shortage. We determine which economic sectors consume the greatest quantities of water, both directly and indirectly, and to what extent this natural resource may become a limiting factor in the growth of certain production sectors. The model allows us to distinguish between direct and indirect consumption, thus offering the possibility of designing an economic and environmental policy oriented towards water saving. Additionally, the model allows simulation of possible changes in water consumption caused by certain environmental measures, as well as their consequences on the regional economy."

From a panel data corresponding to the period of 2014–2017 and a sample of 27 open data leader countries, the incidence of open data on the economic field is examined. The dependent variable, economic impact, is a latent variable based on innovation and doing business indicators. Results obtained show there is a significant and positive effect of open data, ICT development and income per capita on the economic impact.},

abstract = "Urban wind energy consists of the utilization of wind energy technology in applications to the urban and suburban built environment. The paper provides some views on the progress made recently in the areas of wind resource assessment in the urban habitat; the utilization of suitable wind turbines for enhancing the exploitation of these resources; and the significant role of knowledge of building and urban aerodynamics for an optimal arrangement of interfacing augmented wind with its extraction mechanisms. The paper is not intended to be exhaustive, rather its purpose is to provide some views on the above-mentioned topics from the viewpoint of wind engineering and industrial aerodynamics in the context of buildings and cities."

abstract = "Wind energy is a promising scheme in the power generation sector due to pollution-free power production and wind resources’ sufficiency worldwide. Installing wind turbines in all the possible extents can mitigate the rising energy demand. Built-up areas possess high potential for wind energy, including the rooftop of high-rise buildings, railway track, the region between or around multistoried buildings, and city roads. Harnessing wind energy from these areas is quite challenging since it has dramatic nature and turbulence for higher roughness on urban surfaces. This review paper endeavors to highlight the present status of urban wind farm technology and its commercial and environmental aspects. Observations and upcoming research trends have been presented based on up-to-the-minute information. It is concluded that further investigation of wind mapping and the suitable design of turbines is essential to make the urban wind farm a reliable and feasible option for decentralized power generation."
